    <h1>Krishna Shah Welcomes You to His Independent Study Project!</h1>
    <p>There were multiple projects that were ISP related. The primary one was CalCoolUs: The Automatic Reverse-Mode Differentiator by me, Aryan Verma, and Brennan Coil. We also independently did a Conspiracies Project.  If not, your correct webpage is located <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a>!</p>
